                    <head>ENGLAND IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>An amusing light on Turkish intrigues in Egypt is thrown by an ingenuously artful letter
                        which has been written to the Editor of the “Standard” by Mustapha Kamel Pacha, and
                        which we reproduce in another column of to-day’s issue. Last autumn, it may be 
                        remem-bered, the writer was sharply criticised by the Standard's Berlin Correspondent
                        He had been engaged in the patriotic task of trying to induce the German Government to
                        interfere in our management of affairs in the Valley of the Nile. This charge he does
                        not deny (why should he ?), but launches forth into a general defence of the pan-Islamic
                        movement. It is not anti-Christian, he says, but he confesses that it is anti-British.
                        As a matter of fact (as the “Standard” says in commenting on the letter), it is also
                        anti-Christian, but, so far as our immediate duty goes, it is enough that the agitation
                        is being conducted against our authority in Cairo. Mustapha Kamel Pacha tells us that
                        we promised to evacuate the country and have not redeemed our pledge. Well, whose fault
                        is that? In 1887 a distinct and definite offer was made by Lord Salisbury to the Porte,
                        but the Turks refused on the ground that we claimed the right of returning in case of
                        disorder being revived. The Turks had no use for Egypt except as field far peculation,
                        and Sir Henry Wolff's mission came to an end. It is surprising that a man of the world 
                        like Mastapha Kamel Pacha—not to say a cosmopolitan—should think he is doing any good
                        to the Sultan by talking about British neglect of the “rights of the Egyptians.” What
                        Egyptians ? Mastapha Kamel Pacha is concerned, not for the Fellaheen, but for the Turks,
                        who are no longer allowed to prey upon them. He is sorry for the tigers who have no 
                        Christians to eat! The deliver-ance of the Sadan from the Mahdi’s oppres-sion is
                        represented as another wrong to an oppressed nationality. We have wrenched it, he says,
                        from the Egyptians ! Does he believe that English readers of newspapers are so hopelessly 
                        ignorant as to believe that the Mahdi was a patriotic Prince fighting in the national cause
                        ? What, we should like to ask, would have become of Mastapha Kamel Pacha and other 
                        semi-civilised Turks if the Khalifa had made his way to Cairo and, to put the matter gently,
                        “assumed the direction of affairs”? He and his brethren, as representing a slightly 
                        higher stage of oulture, would have been sold into slavery, unless they had been executed
                        off the spot. Is it a change of masters that he sighs for ? If the Germans or French had 
                        undertaken the control of Egypt, does he suppose that he would have been permitted to 
                        indite letters of free criticism to the Berlin or Paris Press ? He laughs to scorn the 
                        suggestion that in demanding the other day the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Tabah we
                        were defending Egypt. What else, then, were we doing! We were preventing the Saltan’s 
                        agents from carry-ing out their plan tor reabsorbing the Khe-dive’s dominions. This, no 
                        doubt, concludes our London contemporary, was inconrenient for the Turkish place-hunters 
                        and concession-mongers. But it saved Egypt from a renewal of the oppressions and exactions 
                        under which it laboured so long as it was governed by Turkish adventurers.</p>

                <head>THE TURKS' INGENIOUS METHOD FOR ASCERTAINING IT.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Jerusalem, June 29.</p>
                    <p>The Boundary Commission arrived at Rafah yesterday and after a stay of three
                        days will proceed to El-Arish, whence they will embark for Port Said. It
                        appears that the demarcation of the boundary line from Akaba to El-Rafah has
                        been satisfactorily marked out. Ssveral military posts will be established
                        by Turkey along the frontier.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the Frontier Commission will remain for the present at
                        Rafah, where the final disoussions between the delegates appointed by the
                        respective Governments will be held. z</p>
                    <p>The Constantinople Correspondent of the "Petit Parisien”learns that the
                        method to be adopted by the Turkish Commissioners with regard to the
                        disputed boundary line between Egypt and Turkey is as follows: The
                        commissioners will take the declaration of the wandering tribes as to
                        whether such territory is Turkish or Egyptian to the exclusion of all maps
                        and geographical configuration, This method of inquiry from the wandering
                        Bedouin tribes was adopted by the Turks when the boundary pillars
                        disappeared near El Arish, at the Mediterranean end of the boundary line.
                        They induced several sheikhs in the south of Palestine to declare that the
                        pillars in question did not mark the boundary. Similar success would no
                        doubt attend their efforts on the present occasion, but Major Owen and
                        Ibrahim Fathi Pash*, who are acting for Egypt, will have something to say to
                        this transparent triok.</p>

                        with illuminated addresses embodying testimonials of their esteem and

                    <p>While bathing in the sea near the Ramleh ooast, opposite the Coastguard
                        station at Halt No. 2, a native was carried out of his depth, and was in
                        imminent danger of drowning, when three coastguardsmen went to his
                        assistance and brought him safely ashore. There was a rather heavy sea
                        running at the time and there is no doubt that had it not been for the
                        prompt aotion of his rescuers the man would have been drowned, as he was in
                        a state of collapse. The gallant coastguardsmen, we are glad to learn, have
                        been recommended for a suitable reward.</p>

                    <p>Mr. C. J. Alford, in a voluminous report, once pointed out that the tradition
                        of the existenoe of coal or carboniferous deposits in the valley of the Nile
                        had been extant for many years, and that about 70 years ago a party of
                        Frenchmen found some deposits of coal or lignite in the Wady Keneh, about 18
                        miles north-west of Keneh town. Subsequently to the issue of this report,
                        and largely on the advice of Jehu son Pacha, whose long residence in and
                        acquaintance with the country entitles him to be considered an expert on all
                        questions a Quoting the industrial resources of Egypt, a syndicate was
                        formed to take over a total area of about 12,000 square miles of what were
                        believed to be coal-bearing lands. Some of these lands are situated in the
                        Sinai peninsula, whence it is stated that coal and lignite have often been
                        brought to Suez. Those who are interested in the commercial development of
                        Egypt would like to know what progress the syndicate has made in the way of
                        getting saleable coal to bank. The importance of properly operated coal
                        mines to the country is incalculable, and one would be glad to hear that the
                        syndicate had realised the anticipations ot those who originally formed it.

                        <head>MUSTAPHA KAMEL’S PLEA-</head>
                    <p>Mustapha Pacha Kamel writes as follows to the London “Standard” :—</p>
                    <p>Sir,—I read the message of yonr Berlin Correspondent concerning my visit to
                        the capital of Germany last autumn, and my interviews with her diplomatists.
                        So I desired to furnish him here with answers of his involved questions in
                        that message, and to repudiate some of the false reports whioh appeared in
                        the English papers about me and my country.</p>
                    <p>I had not called upon Constantinople last autumn as was reported by your
                        Berlin Correspondent, and had not conferred with one of the German
                        diplomatists on “Sinai question,” for I did not contemplate that such a
                        question would be existed before the diplomatic world.</p>
                    <p>I also believed, and still believe, that Turkey was not clearing the ground
                        for this emergency before its issue,as was claimed by some writers. My visit
                        to Berlin was confined to interviews and parleys on different topics. It is
                        true that I expressed my astonishment at the support given by Germany to
                        England in Egypt, and her aid to the British occupation from the beginning
                        till the present time, although she proclaimed, and still proclaims, that
                        she sympathises with Moslems and desires to gain their friendship and good
                        will. The declaration of these ideas and my defending the rights of my
                        country, can not be regarded by the just as intriguing.</p>
                    <p>Plotting is not my characteristic, nor, I believe, that it is in the interest
                        of my Country.</p>  

                    <p>All English papers had committed many Units in diverse matters concerning
                        Egypt and her people. They stated that the anti-English movement in Egypt is
                        an Islamic activity which has in view the persecution of the Christians in
                        general. This is a very great misapprehension and an awful charge, which we
                        can not accept at all. We Egyptians know Islamism in its true sense. We know
                        very well that it is the religion of progress, justice and civilisation and
                        that the Christians live in great security under its rule. We know that the
                        easiest path to rise and advance the Moslem nations is to go back to the
                        trne principles of Islam and its sound rales, whioh were the sole cause of
                        the supremacy of Moslems in the past centuries.</p>
                    <p>The European Press err so much by saying that Pan-Islamism tends to waging
                        destructive wars between the Moslems and Christians. Pan-Islamism is but a
                        natural bond which binds Mahometans with each other through the obligations
                        and sanctions of our religion. It has for its end their progress and
                        ascendancy by means of similar methods and measures. For the causes of their
                        backward state are the same. Those are who animated by a trne love to see
                        the human race enjoying with prosperity ought to welcome the movement—Pan
                        Islamism— which t nds to 300,000,000 human beings, with much pleasure.</p>
                    <p>I am of opinion that those who say that this movement is against the
                        civilisation, mislead others and attack civilisation itself. Civilisation
                        involves in its wider sense the prosperity and progress of mankind in
                        general and not the progress of one race to the disadvantage of another, nor
                        the ascendancy of some nations over the others but it implies the respect of
                        the rights and honours of all nations and the individuals in general. The
                        hatred with which the Egyptians are animated towards the British occupation
                        is natural. The effects of this hatred were very clear in many
                        occasions.</p>
                    <p>Those who are holding the reins of the English politics are held responsible
                        for that hatred and are its true cause. For they failed to fulfil their
                        promises that were given publicly before the world at large in connection of
                        the evacuation of Egypt. They established the English occupation without any
                        recognised right. Their ambition was not satisfied by such encroachments;
                        but they had gone further. They stood against the rights of the Egyptians
                        and their desires and robbed them every power or authority in their country.
                        They confused the education system in Egypt and moulded it in a very bad
                        style. They waged destructive wars against the poor classes—the largest
                        classes—by means of clearing their sons of the Government schools. The
                        Britisher who is astonished at such sentiments which animate the Egyptians
                        may ask himself, “What would he do if England were occupied by a foreign
                        Power which follows the same course and attitude followed by the English in
                        Egypt!!!”</p>
                    <p>Of course the partisans of the English Occupation in Egypt say that it had
                        enjoyed prosperity and wealth in the days of this occupation Although the
                        most benefited by that wealth and prosperity are the outsiders, we publicly
                        declare thart wealth does not make the wise forget this country and the
                        dearness of its supremacy. So we prefer poverty accompanied by independence
                        to riches combined with occupation,</p>
                    <p>The English papers expressed much surprise at the love aud sympathy shown
                        towards Turkey by the Egyptians. There is no reason for such astonishment at
                        all. For Turkey, in spite of the Islamic ties which hind us with her had
                        respected autonomy tince; it had been conferred by her upon Egypt up to the
                        present time. It had widened its circle in the days of Ismail Pacha instead
                        of attacking it. Her respect to the independence of Egypt had gone more
                        further. She refused to accept what was proposed by the Europe daring
                        Arahy’s revolution that she may send a Tuikish army to occupy the Nile
                        Valley, and put an end to that rising. Had Turkey complied with that
                        proposal, she would have served herself aud Egypt by securing her
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>Her refusal indicates that she respects so much the independence of Egypt.
                        But England had destroyed that independence by every means in her power, and
                        wrested the Sudan from the Egyptians, for the recovery of which they had
                        sacrified much blood and money. She favoured the Italians with Mosawa,
                        Zeila, and Herar.</p>
                    <p>How then can any one require us not to hate the English occupation ? How can
                        we believe the nonsense which appears in the leased Press by the English
                        which say that England was defending Egypt in Tabah question ?</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                    <p>Sir,—The terrible outrage against British officere still forms a prominent
                        topic of conversation throughout Egypt, and now is the time when the
                        prevention of similar occurrences in the future should be discussed, and the
                        voice of the thinking public heard.</p>
                    <p>The severity of the sentences which were passed upon those who were found
                        guilty ot taking a leading part in the attack will doubtless serve as a
                        deterrent for some time to come, and, I trust, we shall hear of no farther
                        similar incident either in the near or remote future. We cannot, however,
                        close our eyes to the fact that this occurrence is an exceptionally painful
                        illustration of the lawlessness and-even savagery of certain sections of the
                        fellaheen. In some districts the fellah is a hard working, law-abiding man
                        who only concerns himself with the fruitful labouring of his land. In many
                        districts, however, and chiefly in the provinces ot Menoufieh, Behera, and
                        the Fayonm, he has shown himself to be revengeful and criminal and he does
                        not hesitate to commit murder, devastate his enemies' crops, or slaughter
                        his cattle. The only punishment, save death, now inflioted for such crimes
                        is imprisonment, and with such characters this fails to serve its end. A
                        correspondent whom you sent to inquire into the facts of the attack on
                        British officers at Denishwai remarked that the villagers are wont to use
                        the taunt, “You’ve never been in prison.” Imprisonment ot such people is but
                        giving them food and lodging free with probably less bard labour than they
                        are accustomed to in their fields. For them incarceration holds no shame,
                        nor do they lose by it, for their families carry on their work. The
                        infliction of fines is useless as it bat results in imprisonment owing to
                        the refusal of the fellah to part with the smallest sum of money.</p>
                    <p>It is necessary, therefore, that in order to suppress the far too rampant
                        criminality of certain villages in Egypt, some other form of punishment be
                        made legal, and there only remains, as far as I can see, the re-institution
                        of corporal punishment. The certain knowledge that the commission of a crime
                        would entail the infiotion of severe bodily pain is the only thing which
                        could make the criminal stay his hand. He fears this above all others,
                        except the extreme penalty of death, and if corporal punishment were again
                        made law we should see a rapid decrease in crime.</p>
                    <p>It also behoves the Egyptian Government to enforce severe punishment for
                        perjury. The commission of peijury is so common that it is almost safe to
                        say that no case in which natives are concerned is heard without witnesses
                        perjuring themselves. The evidence of the cubashi of police at the trial at
                        Chibin el Korn is a proved example of the perjury of native witnesses, and
                        very many others might be quoted. Let the punishment for perjury be made
                        severe aud the prosecution of those who bear false witness be strenuously
                        carried out and it will then In found that the work of the judges will be
                        greatly simplified and the just sentencing of the guilty far more certain.—I

                    <p>An unpleasant story comes from Menoufieh, where a British official
                        temporarily employed by the Irrigation Department was stoned during the
                        exercise of his duties by a party of fellaheen and received injuries which
                        were painful if not dangerous. It appears that a sheikh who was
                        accompanying the official did hot dare to give him the names of the
                        fellaheen involved or of the village to which they belonged.</p>

                    <head>KHEDIVE’S ABRUPT DEPARTURE.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Constantinople, Jane 26.</p>
                    <p>The rather sudden departure of the Khedive from Stamboul is attributed in
                        various quar ters to the peculiar action of the Tarkish authorities in
                        having stopped work on the palace which His Highness is having built at
                        Tchiboukli, on the Asiatic shore of the Bospborns. All the workmen engaged
                        thereon have been dismissed, on the pretext of not being provided with
                        tezkerehs.</p>
                    <p>Several European journals have invented a number of stories to explain the
                        real motive of the Turks. One is strangely ingenious, if not fascinating. It
                        is that the Khedive intended storing cannon in this palace, and setting np a
                        Marconi plant which, via a castle on the Isle of Prinkipo, would
                        communicate secretly with the British' warships off the Dardanelles.</p>
                    <p>But that the Porte is vexed with the African Vilayet there is no denying, for
                        the other day the Greek news sheet, the “Constantinople,” was closed by
                        censorial o-der for presuming to advertise the Anglo-Egyptian Bank’s agency,
                        to be shortly installed in Galata. “Anglo-Egyptian” is a term which, like
                        the incabus of nightmare, troubles the slumber of the Turk. It is like the
                        early Egyptian cnonmberi— indigestible.</p>
                    <p>Ghaxt Mukhtar Pacha,</p>
                    <p>Poor old Mukhtar ! Sinai has thundered forth his doom, and intrigue is busy
                        at Yildiz for his exodus from the Sweet Waters of Africa. Already a list of
                        candidates has been drawn np ot those most likely to succeed his Excellency.
                        Nothing is yet officially known as to what Mukhtar’s fate will be; but
                        whatever the decision arrived at, the Saltan may rest assured that the myth
                        of Tarkish rule in Egypt is dissipated, and that through his clumsy modus
                        procedendi at Akaba, whioh has cost him more than even a military defeat.
                        The British Government had thus far suffered the picturesque anomaly of an
                        Ottoman High Commissioner, but there are signs that this time, the picture
                        is to be rejected altogether.</p>
                    <p>Trouble on the lsmallia,</p>
                    <p>A scuffle which nearly assumed the proportions of a pitched battle took place
                        the other day on board the Khedivial S.S. Ismailia, as she was nearing
                        harbonr. A Mussulman named Abraham struck a Samiote, who returned the
                        compliment, whereapon there ensued a scene of disorder,</p>
                    <p>Betrothal,</p>
                    <p>Cairo society will receive with pleasure the announcement of the betrothal of
                        M. Leon Molho, of the Modiano Bank, and Mile Esther Assayas, of Cairo.</p>

                    <p>GREECE AND ROUMANIA.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—In your yesterday' s extract from the “Globe,” I note with some
                        amusement the designation of “trumpery” as applied to the Kntzo Vlaoh
                        Question. The "Globe" is wrong in making such a statement. The Kutzo Vlaoh
                        Question is at the basis of the present split between Roamania and her
                        National Charob, on the one hand, and Greece and tbe Greek National Church
                        on the other.</p>
                    <p>Church politics are the ruling factors in Macedon to-day as they were under
                        Basil the Bulgar slayer, and had your contemporary the “Globe” a Nearer
                        insight into the situation, as it is, in the three vilayets, it would never
                        have made such an assertion. The bloodless conflict between the Northern and
                        Southern Kingdoms dates simultaneously with the schism of the Kutzo Vlaoh
                        community from the Greek Church of Constantinople, and it was the breaking
                        off of relations between the Phanar and the Roumanian Government which
                        brought on the present one-sided strife. M. Skouzea and his compeers, with
                        the subtility of Greek diplomacy, naturally affect an utter astonishment at
                        the irreconciliable attitude of the Roumanian Government, which they
                        pretend not to understand. But if the truth be known it is the creation of a
                        semi-autonomous community sympathetic with Roumanian aspirations in
                        Macedonia which is objectionable to Hellas' dream of a Greek Principality in
                        the home of Alexander the Great. Peace can only be restored by the
                        intermediation of the Holy Synod of Cons: tantinople—Yours etc.,</p>

                        third-class Medjidieh. For his services in connection with the Crofter

                    <p>A very pleasant game was played at the Soldiers’ Clnb, Cairo, on Wednesday
                        last in the final competition (for the Cop presented by the club) between
                        teams of sergeants from the 1st Battalion King’s Royal Rifle Corps and the
                        1st Battalion Lancashire Fasiliers, the former winning rather easily by 120
                        points. We congratulate this sporting battalion on seoaring the 1st prize in
                        this competition, as also the one for the lance corporals and privates, the
                        Lancashire Fasiliers having been runners up in both competitions.</p>
