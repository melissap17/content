                    <head>A PARLIAMENT FOR EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>In an  article under the above tite  the "Spectator" remarks :
                        We are convinced that the present House of   Commons, and the
                        Liberal Party which controls it by so huge majority, are sincerely
                        anxious to do everything in their power for the welfare of Egypt. 
                        They desire that the Egyptins should be well governed, and should be
                        free from those influences of tyranny and corruption which unfortunately
                        are almost always the fate of Eastern nations when left to the control
                        of native rulers. We have only to study the present condition of Morocco, 
                        of Turkey, and of  Persia, and to note the methods of government there 
                        adopted, to realise what "Home-rule" means in the East. It means oppression
                        and cruelty and unbridled liccuse at the top, and misery and degradation at
                        the bottom. From these conditions the people of Egypt, whose history during
                        the past five or six hundred years has been one long tale of servitude and 
                        shame, have lately been rescued by the wisdom and justice of British rule. 
                        Our government in Egypt may not have beenn perfect - few human institutions
                        can claim that attribute - but  at any rate it has raised the position of the 
                        Egyptian peasent, and much of the poorer classes generally, from one which is
                        is no exaggeration to deseribe as the most unhappy on the face of the earth to
                        one of happiness and prosperity.
                         When we went to Egypt the population was not only taxed so heavily that the 
                         tax-collector left the villager nothing but the barest subsidence allowance,
                         but by means of a system of forced labour he was reduced to a Condition 
                         bordering on servitude. Now, after some twenty  years of British control, 
                         there is no other Mohamedan cultivator of the soil or inhabitant of a town 
                         who is in so good a position. The taxes are collected justly, and Lhe poor
                         man is now able to rise through his own efforts to a level, not merely of
                         comfort, but of aflluence. He is no longer afraid to show his wealth lest the
                         demands of the taxpayer should be increased, and he is able to rely upon the
                         government to protect him from the arbitrary oppression of those who are richer
                         than himself or who hold an official poisition. 
                          We are now asked to destroy the welfare that has been thus won. That, in plain English,
                         is the meaning of demand that Egypt shall be endowed  with fu11 Parliamentary institutions,
                         and the Egyptians are allowed to govern themselves. The demand for such institutions has
                         been made by the Egyptian General Assembly; and since this change cannot, for manny reasons, 
                         be carried out immediately it is suggested that the British Government should at once confer
                         with the existing Legislative Council and upon, the General Assembly powers which would place
                         the complete control of the finances and of the administration of Egypt in their hands. We are 
                         well aware that there is a little danger of the present Government listening to any such proposals 
                         as those. There is, however, a certain danger of well meaning persons here who value and rightly
                         value, Free Parliamentary institutions, being misled. Into thinking that they are as applicable to
                         the East as to the West.
                         
                         The "Spectator," after an analysis of the influences which have been at work, asks what is the 
                         ordinary Briton to do, and answers the question thus: in our opinion he has only one course open to 
                         him. He must keep his eye solely on one object, and that object good government for Egypt. As long 
                         as he provides such good government, he is doing his duty to the uttermost, and, paradoxically as it 
                         may seem, he is also fulfilling the ideal of the Egyptians. It is only through Western control and 
                         Western sovereignty that the Oriental can really secure the government. which he most desires,--the 
                         government of the sane and beneficent despot tempered by public opinion. He cannot make sure of getting
                         it through an hereditary despot, because it is impossible to guarantee a line of beneficent despots. He
                         cannot, again, under modern conditions, obtain. it by the old system of intermittent revolution. When, 
                         however, the appointment and control of the reigning despot are vested in a self-governing Western nation,
                         he has his best security that the despot will be a true trustee. We have provided Egypt with such a despot
                         in Lord Cromer, an autocrat who intensely desires the good of the country he governs, and who is always 
                         willing and ready to be guided by the reasonable public opinion of these over whom he rues.  When Lord Cromer's
                         rule comes to an end we may be certain that the British democracy will make every effort to secure a ruler
                         who shall be capable of carrying on his trusteeship. In other words, the British democracy can give, and if it
                         does its duty wiII continue to give, the Egyptian the form of government which suites him best, and which,
                         except only in name, he most desires.  At heart, his only real grievance against the kind of government we 
                         supply is that it is not quite arbitrary and occasional enough, and  acts somewhat too much on rigid principles.
                         We have only one more word to say, and that is to warn the people of Egypt that the one thing which the 
                         British people will not consent to is to share the ultimate responsibility of the government of Egypt with
                         them or anybody else. Either the British people must be responsible and must say the final word, or else we
                         must hand over to the Egyptians their government out and out. The notion that we are by our Navy to protect 
                         their coasts from foreign invasion, either by the Turks or some other European Power, and also to organize
                         their military forces in order to put down internal revolts and to Protect them from fanatical incursions like 
                         those of the Dervishes, while the Pasha class under some travesty of representative institution, exploits the 
                         wealth of Egypt and pillages the small cultivator, is one which must be made clear will never be tolerated in 
                         this country. We have had in the past generation experience in native States in India of such regimes, and they
                         have always. Resulted in shame to us and misery to the subject populations. The worst pages in our Indian history
                         are that which tell how the East India Company from motives of policy. kept bad and inefficient native rulers on
                         their thrones by the aid of British military power. As we have said, either we must fully abandon Egypt to her fate,
                         or we must rule as trustees who are determined to secure the government of the people, and to protect the peasant 
                         not only against the oppressions of those above him, but from his own fatuity and infirmity of purpose. Such supreme 
                         control is of course perfectly compatible, as we have already proved with allowing a very large share in the 
                         administration of their country to native Egyptians, and also with a wise and enlightened deference to the best 
                         expressions of Egyptian public opinion. What it is not consistent with is the establishment of any form of so-called 
                         Egyptian Parliamentary control. To pretend otherwise is to run the risk of throwing Egypt back into the misery, 
                         oppression, and corruption from which the British people saved her through the instrumentality of Lord Cromer and 
                         the men who have worked under him. We say the British people” advised, for, greatly as we admire lord Cromer’s 
                         achievement, and acknowledge the value of his work, it is. In the last resort to the political instincts and to
                         the governing traditions of the British people as a whole that we must give the credit of what has been accomplished 
                         in Egypt. It because our people. and our parliament understand the art of ruling Orien¬tal peoples, and of infusing
                         into that rule the essential principles of liberty, that we have succeeded in Egypt. We have never for one moment 
                         attempted to exploit Egypt for our own benefit. On the contrary we have kept before us, in spite of many temptations,
                         the fundamental rule that, we must govern Egypt as we govern India, --in the interests of the governed. As long as
                         we stick faithfully to that rule we need have no fear of being overcome by any conscientious misgivings as to our 
                         rights, and no fear also of our rule being swept away by those who we govern.
