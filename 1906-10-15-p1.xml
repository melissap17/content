                            <p>Commenting on the publication of the Memoirs of Prince Hohenlohe, the
                                "Morning Post" says:-</p>
                            <p>A twofold interest attaches to the publication in Germany of extracts
                                from the Memoirs of Prince Hohenlohe giving an account of the points
                                of disagreement between the German Emperor and Prince Bismarck which
                                led to the Prince's resignation of the Chancellorship of the
                                Empire.</p>
                            <p>The resignation of the First Chancellor was an event of historical
                                importance, and everything that throws light upon it and enables the
                                truth to be known is valuable to the student of history and of
                                politics. The fact of the publication of these extracts from Prince
                                Hohenlohe's Memoirs has, however, to be regarded also from another
                                point of view. The story told throws light upon the character and
                                policy of the present German Emperor. The publication, therefore,
                                would hardly have been risked in a country where free discussion of
                                the Emperor's character and policy is not permitted, unless it was
                                likely to be acceptable in high quarters. It may, therefore, be
                                taken to be thought opportune that these disclosures should now be
                                made; in other words, it is thought that they will have the effect
                                in Germany of strengthening public confidence in the Emperor. The
                                story told is exceedingly probable. It agrees with what was relieved
                                at the time by the best informed diplomatists in Europe. Moreover,
                                it rests upon the best possible authorities, for Prince Hohenlohe
                                records his conversations with the Empress Frederick and the Grand
                                Duke of Baden, as well as with the Emperor and Prince Bisraark. The
                                disagreements turned on two points of policy. One was domestic. The
                                Emperor was anxious for further action by way of relieving the lot
                                of the working class.</p>
                            <p>He thought that if nothing were done the Socialists would have a
                                lever by which they might raise up a movement that would need to be
                                put down by force, and he was determined at the beginning of his
                                reign not to be forced to let his soldiers Are upon the people. But
                                Bismarck was opposed to further legislation in the direction of
                                State Socialism. The other difference was on foreign policy. The
                                Emperor thought it right to support his Austro-Hungarian ally in
                                resistance to contemplated Russian encroachments in South- Eastern
                                Europe. If the Russian Government had moved an Army towards Bulgaria
                                the Austro-Hungarian Government would have been bound in its own
                                interests to that movement. The German Emperor thought that in such
                                a case he must come to the assistance of Austria-Hungary. But
                                Bismarck proposed that if the case were to arise Germany should
                                remain neutral. He was afraid that supporting Austria would involve
                                Germany in the war which he dreaded against Russia and France at
                                once. These were serious differences, for they touched, the one a
                                vital matter of domestic policy, and the other the cardinal point of
                                foreign policy. But there was a further disagreement of a formal
                                nature. When Bismarck became Minister-President of Prussia under
                                King William I. there was in existence a Cabinet Order, that is, a
                                Royal rescript, dated 1852-in the reign of King Frederick William
                                IV.-by which the Ministers other than the Minister-President were
                                debarred from direct access to the King. Bismarck, as
                                Minister-President, for many years acted in the spirit of this
                                decree. He made himself responsible to the King for Prussian policy,
                                and he enjoyed the King's confidence. Accordingly at one time he
                                paid little attention to the letter of the decree. But, on the
                                accession of William II. as Emperor and King, Bismarck worked the
                                decree of 1852 for all it was worth in order to keep in his own
                                hands the control of affairs. The Emperor wished to be able to
                                consult other Ministers as well as Bismarck, and desired the old
                                rule to 1)6 abrogated. When it became clear to him that there was a
                                real and profound disagreement between himself and his Chancellor he
                                sent to ask Bismarck for either his acquiescence in the abrogation
                                of the rule or his resignation. Bismarck replied by sending his
                                resignation. The Emperor felt that the point had come when it was a
                                question whether he should be Emperor in fact as well as in name, or
                                merely an Emperor reigning but not governing, taking his directions
                                from a Mayor of the Palace. This part of the story has been told
                                before. The exact nature of the disagreement on Germany's foreign
                                policy has hardly been as clearly put, so far as we remember, as it
                                is in Prince Hohenlohe's Memoirs. Very characteristic are some of
                                the details of the picture. Bismarck's violent temper was well
                                known. He has himself told how after a political argument he would
                                relieve his feelings by breaking something. After one of the last
                                angry outbursts the Emperor told the Grand Duke of Baden that
                                Bismarck had just managed not to throw the inkpot at his head, and
                                the Grand Duke himself a few days later found Bismarck so rude that
                                he had to bring the audience to an abrupt close. In all probability
                                the Emperor was substantially in the right on the points in dispute.
                                It was wiser to take some steps towards meeting the working-men's
                                troubles than to do nothing and await a conflict. It was probably
                                wiser and was certainly more loyal to support Austria-Hungary
                                against Russia than to remain neutral and encourage Russia. It was
                                certainly better for Germany that there should be a Monarchy than
                                that there should be a Bismarck dynasty. The interesting question is
                                why the present moment should be chosen for the publication of these
                                details. The purpose maybe to stem the growth of the Bismarck
                                legend, which has been remarkable during the last few years, and to
                                remind the German public that, great as Bismarck was, he was nothing
                                without the support of King William I., and in his quarrel with the
                                present Emperor was in form and substance in the wrong. A different
                                explanation has been suggested, very shrewdly, in Austria. There the
                                theory is that the publication has for its purpose to show, what is
                                the fact, that in a crisis when the fate of the Dual Monarchy was at
                                stake the Emperor William was that Monarchy's firm friend and
                                steadfast ally. In either case, we venture to think, only good can
                                come of the truth becoming known. There is a good deal yet to be
                                known about Bismarck, not by any means all to his credit. He
                                himself, by the heartless cruelty with which he persecuted those who
                                happened to disagree with him, made upon those who were behind the
                                scenes an indelible impression of brutality. He was a bully, and his
                                policy was that of a bully. The revelations now- made, which will in
                                part be new to the bulk of the German public, will help German
                                opinion to see in truer perspective the personages of the reign of
                                the first Emperor, whom in the public eye Bismarck has too much
                                overshadowed. Moltke was a greater man than the Germans of to-day.
                                except a small number of officers, seem to realise, and the Emperor
                                William I, who was able to appreciate and to support two such
                                different men as Bismarck and Moltke and to keep them together in
                                harness in spite of their differences, rendered to his country
                                services which can hardly be over-estimated. One result of the
                                publication now made may be to stimulate curiosity as to the later
                                portions of Bismarck's own Memoirs. It is hardly likely that they
                                will modify very materially the story which is told in the
                                contemporary notes of Prince Hohenlohe. </p>
