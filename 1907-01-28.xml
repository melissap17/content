                    <head>THE GERMAN ELECTIONS.</head>
                    <p>Our telegrams state that the most important election ever held in Germany has
                        resulted in favour of the Kaiser and a Government majority seems now
                        certain. The issue was of enormous importance, for the Germans had to choose
                        between two alternatives, whether the Hohenzollern dynasty was to dictate
                        the policy of the Empire without asking popular advice, or whether the
                        people were to have &amp; larger share of self government and a more final
                        control of their own taxation. The German people, as the results of the
                        elections show, have decided that they wish to be governed directly by the
                        Emperor and his representatives in preference to exercising themselves a
                        controlling influence over their own destiny Heine says somewhere that an
                        Englishman loves liberty steadily as he loves his lawful wife, a Frenchman
                        passionately as a mistress, but a German’s love of liberty is as a man’s
                        love for his grandmother.</p>
                    <p>The truth of this comparison is seen in these elections. The German people
                        are just awakening to self-consciousness, and with it to an intense desire
                        for a larger share in the control of administration. They think that if
                        colonial policy costs money, they ought to have an equal vote with their
                        Sovereign in colonial policy. The last vote of the late Reichstag directly
                        impaired the prerogative implied in the Kaiser’s claim to be War-Lord, for
                        through it he ceased to be able to keep sufficient troops in his South-West
                        African possessions, where war is actually raging. The Emperor therefore, in
                        his owh opinion, had the only alternative of</p>

                    <p>asking his people whether they really meant him to give way before the
                        opposition of his dark subjects in South Africa. He determined on a bold
                        course, and by dissolving the Reichstag called on the people of Germany to
                        stultify the decision and authority of their representative body. The
                        Kaiser’s action clearly showed the German people thta he was ready to
                        disallow the authority of the Reichstag, and that it was the duty of his
                        subjects to simply obey and give him the means which he thinks his military
                        policy requires. The German people have replied the Emperor’s challenge with
                        all due sub missiveness and have given him a majority instead of returning a
                        Reichstag which would demand full control over its own finances. In other
                        words, they havo deliberately thrown away their rights to a larger share of
                        self government for the sake of the Kaiser’s Wel Politik. The issue was
                        clearly put before the German people, and neither the Emperor nor his
                        opponents endeavoured to minimise the momentous nature of the struggle.</p>
                    <p>Herr Maximilian Harden, in his weekly review, “Die Zukunft,” describing the
                        issues before the German people in the elections, said:— “We want to rule
                        ourselves as well and as conscientiously as we can. The German may be proud
                        of much that his country has produced. The German peasant, artisan, soldier,
                        and business man can hold his own with any. There is great activity among
                        the arts, in industry, in banking, in commerce, and at least as much is
                        accomplished as in other countries and with scanty means. . . . But we are
                        badly governed, and the most important State institutions no longer satisfy
                        the demands of the times. In international politics we Can do nothing
                        considerable for years to come, thanks partly to Uncle Edward and partly to
                        our own fault. . . . Things cannot possibly go worse than they have under a
                        Hohenlohe or a Bulow ; our next aim must be to assure Parliamentary
                        government.” These opinions were re-echoed throughout all the Liberal and
                        Socialist Press of the Fatherland. The appeals on the other side were no
                        less vigorous The Conservative “Reichsbote ’’(Berlin, Jan. 8)says :—“A
                        determining fight has begun for the maintenance of our national honour, for
                        the future, even for the very existence, of the Empire. The German people
                        must now prove whether they can keep sacred the hardly won fruits of 1870,
                        or whether egotism and political and national indifference have consumed the
                        springs of life of the German nation, and will now deliver the latter over
                        to the dominion of elements owning no Fatherland. ... If the anti-national
                        parties are returned to the Reichstag in undiminished force, this will be
                        the signal for joint action by Germany’s foes ; it will be the prelude to a
                        great struggle for the annihilation of everything German, which has for
                        years been the dream of the Slav, Romanic, and Anglo-Saxon worlds. . . .
                        During the past few years the German Empire has forfeited much of its former
                        prestige, a fact which is due partly to want of firmness on the part of the
                        Government, but chiefly to the deplorable attitude assumed by our Imperial
                        Parliament. The security of the Empire demands imperatively that our
                        national prestige abroad shall not suffer further. The 25th of January
                        decides. If on that day victory is with those who on Dec. 13 refused to
                        grant a vote for South-West Africa, if victory is with Ultramontanism, which
                        is inimical to the Empire, the time will have come when our enemies will
                        believe the moment for revenge has arrived. We shall then in a very short
                        time hear the rattle of musketry in the Vosges; Polish hordes will carry
                        fire and sword through the East of the Empire, and the thunder of the
                        'Dreadnought’s’ guns will roar off the German emporium of Hamburg. We shall
                        have peace only if Germany is united and strong.”</p>
                    <p>From a purely impartial view of the election results it is clear that,
                        despite the great progress of the Socialist Party during the last few years,
                        the masses of the German people are still unconscious of the elements of
                        political emancipation and prefer to be governed by an autocrat rather than
                        by parliamentary principles such as prevail in England. After all, their
                        decision may be politically a sound one, but that is for the historians of
                        the future to decide.</p>
                    <p>Although no definite decision has been arrived at with regard to the opening
                        of the next Reichstag, it is believed in trustworthy quarters that the
                        opening ceremony will take place either on February 14 or February 19. It is
                        not likely that the Reichstag will sit longer than four months at the most.
                        Its work will consist in bringing forward and voting upon the supplementary
                        credits, the next Budget, the projected law with regard to professional
                        societies, and perhaps, if necessary, one or other of the treaties of
                        commerce which have been left in abeyance for the time. All other measures
                        will be postponed until the Session of next autumn.</p>

                        development of the com-pany’s business rendered a change of premises
                        necessary, and there is no doubt that with tbe forthcoming increase of its
                        capital tbe Comptoir will occupy an important position among the credit
                        establishments of our city. </p>

                    <p>The scheme for the erection of a new church and school for the German
                        Evangelical community in Cairo is progressing favourably. Already several
                        meetings of the leading members of tbe colony have been held, and at the
                        last M. Mefz, church-warden, read a report on the sale ot the present
                        buildings and the pur- chase of the land at Boulae on which the new premises
                        are to be built. The German Consol heartily approved of the operations. The
                        Pastor proposes building a church for three or four hundred people, and a
                        school with baths, refectories, and accommodations for the faculty. This
                        scheme would leave a surplus of land which could be sold or rented according
                        to circumstances.</p>

                        proprietor who does not forget the jaded official and business man whose
                        work keeps him in Egypt throughout the summer months. Visitors to the Saan
                        Stefano Casino next summer will be agreeably surprised at the enormus
                        alterations that are being made there; the hotel, whilst being greatly
                        enlarged, being practically re-built, and we understand that ahoot £50,000
                        is to be expended on it. The work has been placed in the hands of the
                        Egyptian Constructions, Limited, who have undertaken to have the building
                        ready for the reception of guests in April next, and this will mesh a

                    <p>This morning the ceremony took place of replacing the Imperial coat of arms
                        whioh was torn down from its position over the door of the Russian Consulate
                        at Alexandria by the mob yesterday week. Shortly after 10 o’o’ock the
                        Snb-Governor of Alexandria, Mo- hamed Bey Hafiz (in lieu of Mustapha Pasha
                        Ibadi) the Governor, who is indisposed, arrived at the Russian Consulate, in
                        full uniform, in order to represent the Egyptian Government at the ceremony.

                        Alexandria City Police, and Kaimakam Cobbe Bey the Sub-Commandant. The Guard
                        Company and the Police Band were drawn up in tbe Ramleh Boulevard in front
                        of the Consulate. All traffic was stopped, but there was not a great crowd
                        of spectators present as it wan not generally known that the ceremony would
                        take place this morning.</p>
                    <p>M. A. N. d’Ahezi. the Imperial Russian Consul at Alexandria, took up his

                        entrace to the Consulate. The Russian flag was flown over the Consulate, the
                        Guard Company presented arms, and the Police Band played the Imperial
                        Russian Anthem, while all the staff of the Russian consulate and the
                        Egyptian officials present sainted. The Russian Consul then shook hands with
                        Mohamed Bey Hafez and there was a general interchange of greetings between
                        the Consular staff and the Egyptian officials. The band then played the
                        Khedivial Hymn, the Imperial coat-of arms was finally adjusted, and amidst
                        another exchange of official handshakes the interesting function was brought

                        the Russian Consulate here, they were taken to, Port Said, where they were
                        embarked on a Russian steamer. The special train was ran direct from Hadra
                        to Port Said without changing. An officer of the Alexandria City Police and
                        twenty Russian detectives were also on the train.</p>
                    <p>THE POLICE CHARGES</p>
                    <p>The only charge brought by the authorities of the Alexandria Government
                        against any British aubject is that against Mr. William Patrick Foley. This
                        man will ba tried as soon as the summons is issued, which will be done on
                        the application of the police authorities. Tbe charges against the subjects
                        of other Powers for taking part in tbe disorders have not yet been made ont,
                        because it is first neccessary for the Egyptian authorities to draw ap
                        "process-verbaux” in such cases, but this procedure is not needed in the
                        case of a British subject, against whom it is only necessary to issue a
                        summons. </p>

                        made since its Alexandria branch was started, and he complimented M. de

                    <head>THE HELOUAN SEASON</head>
                    <p>DANCE AT TEWFIK PLACE</p>
                    <p>The dance at the Tewfik Palaoe Hotel no Saturday night formed a very fitting
                        conclusion to the enjoyable week of festivities at Helouan. The finals of
                        the tennis tournament had been played off that morning, Mrs. Macintosch
                        Walker and Mr. Tomlinson carrying everything before them; and in spite of
                        the hard work of the last few days anrd nights everybody was in excellent
                        form for the last event of the season. There was a large dinner party at the
                        Grand that night at which Messrs. Gunter and Macnaghten presided; and the
                        dining-room at the Tewfik has its full share of cheery parties preparatory
                        to the danee. The programms was an excellent one and a most happy air of
                        friendliness pervaded the precincts of the old palace, everybody knowing
                        everybody, and all bent on enjoying themselves. To enumerate those who were
                        present is but to recapitulate the names of those who also dance 1 through
                        the cheery hours at the Grand on Thursday; and doubtless there will be other
                        occasions in the future when the same merry band of Helousuites will meet
                        again to revive their friendships. At the conclusion of the programme the
                        tennis prizes were distributed in the hall, Miss Tottenham presenting them
                        to the victors, and Mr. Tomlinson proposing a vote of thanks to the afore
                        mentioned lady and to Mr. Sawyer, both of whom had been instrumental in
                        organizing the sports. After tha distribution of prizes an adjournment was
                        made in the direction of the supper room ; and though various more
                        sober-minded of the guests took this opportanity to slip away quietly to
                        their bedrooms, there were others who continued their festivities for some
                        time longer; and strains of music penetrated the adjoining corridors till
                        well into the early hours of the morning.</p>
                    <p>While on the subject of Helouan, mention must be made of the latest addition
                        to the resources of the place in the shape of a delight-ful little chalet
                        'San Giovanni,” which has been erected this season under the anspices of Mr.
                        Springer of Al Hayat. This little cafe- restaurant is situated some two
                        miles from Helouan on the very banks of the Nile and should prove a most
                        delightfol object for an afternoon's drive or ride. It is approached by an
                        excellent road for which thanks are mainly due to Hafez Effendi, that most
                        energetic of inspectors who has already performed wonders in Helouan, and
                        who doubtless will do much more to win the gratitude of the inhabitants. The
                        chalet is a pretty building surrounded by a garden, and has a wide verandah
                        running roand it. Inside it there are dainty tea and reading rooms, while
                        while flat roof spaces as well as the verandahs have also been provided with
                        chairs and tea tables.lt is indeed a delightful little retreat and should be
                        in great quest especially in the warmer weather. The view across the river
                        is perfect; and the arrangements and buildings are as complete and dainty as
                        Mr. Springer knows how to make them. For the convenience of people wishing
                        to visit the cafe, a motor serivice has been instituted, the cars starting
                        from the railway station upon the arrival the trains ; and through "San
                        Giovanni” has only been open for a few short weeks, and the weather has not
                        proved kind to al-fresco meals during that period, people are already
                        finding their way down there in increasing numbers. </p>

                    <head>HELOUAN BATHS</head>
                    <p>Of the various improvements made recently in the celebrated Halouan Bathing
                        Establishment none has been more effective than the heating apparatus which
                        has been installed this year. The old system with its wasteful boilers has
                        now been superseded by a modern hot steam apparatus which not only provides
                        a genial glow over the various rooms and passages of the establishment, but
                        which also supplies heat to the sulphar baths with wonderfal regularity and
                        expedition. Thus in under five minutes the contents of a large bath can be
                        heated to 102° Fahr. with little or no loss of its medicinal qualities; and
                        the heat oan be regulated and maintained in a manner impossible under the
                        old system.</p>
                    <p>These powerful sulphur springs of Helouan have been in use from time
                        immemorial, and are still said to be the finest palliative for all rheumatic
                        and gouty complaints. Under the control of the Government the baths have
                        been equipped with all the latest modern improvements and now compare with
                        those of the best known thermal establishments of Europe. There are separate
                        wings given over to the use of ladies and gentlemen respectively, each
                        containing, in addition to the ordinary large baths in private rooms,
                        various other baths for special purposes. There are the special Helouan
                        sulphur baths in which the patient is massaged by two attendants while lying
                        immersed by the water; there are the new Vichu baths for toning and bracing
                        up the system, the patient lying on india-rubber cushions while needle
                        sprays of water, hot or cold, fall from long pipes overhead; and there are
                        the electric light baths where the patient its within a cabinet lined with
                        over forty electric lights of twenty-five rcandle pewer each. There are also
                        large unroofed swimming baths in the rear of the establishment where the
                        milky white water is somehwere foot deep, and these are well patronized
                        during warmer weather. Dr. Hobson has his consul iug rooms within the
                        establishment and there is a staff of competent r u ses and masseurs to
                        carry out the treatment, the services of two female and four male attendants
                        from Harrogate being requisitioned during the season. At the present moment
                        over 100 baths are taken daily on an average ; and every year sees an
                        addition in the number of the patients who derive benefit</p>

                    <p>from these wonderful waters. The action of the sulphur contained therein is
                        incredible; it tarnishes and corrodes the metal forments of the baths almost
                        as soon as it comes in touch with them, and nothing has yet been discovered
                        to withstand it. However scrupulously clean the baths are kept the enamel is
                        very quickly discoloured by it; and where tiles or bricks are used the
                        surface becomes eaten away in a remarkably short space of time. The wear and
                        tear is consequently very high no pains nor expense are spared to keep the
                        bath and arrangements in as good a condition as possible. </p>

                        anniversary of his birthday, was most loyally celebrated by German subjects
                        throughout Egypt. A special thanksgiving service was he'd at ten o’clock, in
                        the German Protestant Church, in the presence of the German Consul and
                        staff, and the Italian and Austro-Hoagarian Consuls, An official reception
                        was held at the consulate at 11 o’clock which was largely attended. At
                        midday the Krieg Verein Club gave an entertainment at the Swisz Beer Hall,
                        and in the evening there was a great kommers at the Effel Tower Music

                    <p>PRECEDENT FOR MANILA.</p>
                    <p>Washington, January 6.— There is much reason to believe that the issuance of
                        the report of the Bureau of Insular Affairs upon the Agricultural Bank of
                        Egypt will have little influence upon the Senate committee having that
                        matter in charge. The bill introduced by Senator Lodge last spring was hung
                        up in the Senate committee on the Philippines by a very decided majority of
                        members, none of whom, according to recent inqury, have shown any change of
                        position.</p>
                    <p>The bill provides that a guaranty shall be made to the company with
                        headquarters in Manila of an income not exceeding 4 per cent, per annum upon
                        cash capital actually invested in such agricultural bank. The loans are
                        limited to $ 5,000 in any one sum, the interest charge limited to 10 per
                        cent, and no loans shall be made except for the purpose of assisting agri-
                        culture in the Philippine Islands.</p>
                    <p>The special agent appointed by the Bnrean to investigate the operation of the
                        Agricultural Bank in Egypt reports most favourably as to result, and is of
                        the opinion that similar results might be expected in the Philippines,
                        though in a less degree successful. He points out that in all the years of
                        its operations the Government has never been obliged to advance the
                        guarantee. </p>

                    <p>Saturday’s performance of "Lohengrin” did not come up to our expectations,
                        but, to be Irish, we never expected that it would. It was not for want of
                        pains being taken; all worked with sea and seemed surprisingly satisfied
                        with the result. Nevertheless its conception was very far from meeting
                        requirements. It was hard to discover much of the solemn and ethereal
                        harmonies of the Holy Grail, the "symbol of the supra sensual,” amid the
                        almost light-hearted deportment of the orchestra and flaccid sentimentalityy
                        of the performers. The mystic was constantly being sacrificed to the
                        romantic, with a result as unhappy as it was unintelligible. No doabt
                        allowance mast be made for the drama being given in Italian by artiste,
                        whose capabilities are foreign to anything Wagnerian, and before a housee
                        which delights in emitting "bravos” at odd moments and in applauding vooal
                        gym-nasties; but these considerations are hardly sufficient to justify the
                        inadeguate manner in which the work was grasped. Since we have a good
                        all-round opera company this season, it seems a pity that they should try to
                        exceed their limtations when there is so wide a choice within their scope.
                        We are tempted to a Johnsonian reminder: "A cow is a very good animal in the
                        field, but we turn her out of a garden.” </p>

                    <p>The K.S.C. team and the Coldstream Guards team No. I were left in for the
                        final. With any lack the Coldstream Guards would have won, and on the whole
                        they had the best of the game, but they missed their goals, and Mr. Aldam,
                        with a strained arm, was of no use to his side. Mr. Bentinck and Mr. Gibbs
                        played a very good game, showing judgment and skill. And the improvement of
                        the play-of the team in the last two months is most marked, their
                        combination being decidedly good. For the winners, Capt. Bartlett was a host
                        in himself; he kept his team in fairly good order, and they all did their
                        share of the work. </p>

                        yet another was soored by the same player, the score being 3 to 1 in favour
                        of the K.S.C. team. The Coldstream Guards then forced the game, making great
                        efforts to score, but had no luck, their shots at goal always just

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,—I have read with much interest in your issue of yesterday a letter
                        written by ‘A Casual Visitor” on the above subject. He points out the fact
                        that Belgian joists have been employed in the construction, and that the
                        quantity used is about 10,000 tons, a truly noble quantity tor a building of
                        its size. Secondly, he says that the college was called into existence by
                        British enterprise and generosity to commemorate our late Queen Victoria,
                        and complains that the building specifioatiou did not call for British
                        material. I have been in the building business for a number of years, both
                        in this country and in England, and have bought in my time large quantities
                        of Belgian and English joists, and my experiance has taught me that for
                        ordinary building work and such purposes as floors aud ceilings, etc., which
                        is the purpose for which they are required in this instance, Belgian joists
                        art quite good enough, although their ultimate breaking strain might be
                        somewhat lower than that of British joists of similar section. As a set off
                        against this, however, there is a difference of price, the difference being
                        as a role about £2 per ton c.i.f. Alexandria in favour of the Belgian joist,
                        so that, according to ‘A Casual Visitor’*” estimate of the quantities, the
                        committee of the Victoria College may at least congratulate themselves on
                        having saved in 10,000 tons of joists a magnificent sum of about £20,000,
                        which sum it is hoped will be need in furthering the education of the pupils
                        at the college, which might otherwise have been spent in profits to the
                        rolling mills where the British joists wotld have been made. The British
                        Chamber of Commerce can hardly be expected to have very much power in
                        influening the letting of such a contract for joists unless it can induce
                        the British manufacturers to arrive a good deal nearer the mark as regards
                        price, for it is well known among engineers that for ordinary structural
                        work the Continental joist is as suitable as, and far cheaper than the
                        British, although I am willing to admit that, for special purposes, the
                        latter area more reliable. In my opinion the 10,000 tons is rather a full
                        estimate of the quantities ; probably 300 or 400 tons would be nearer the
                        mark. Engineer. Alexandria, Jannary 26. </p>
