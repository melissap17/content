                    <head>THE BARHR EL GHAZAL</head>
                    <p>Among all the enlightening episodes of the "scramble for Africa,'' then are 
                        few chapters more suggestive than that relating to King Leopold's efforts 
                        to extend his Congolese dominions into the basin of the Nile, and we recommend 
                        our readers to persue a detailed history of thia episode, which appears in the 
                        "Times'' of the 28th ult. For twenty years the King has carried on this struggle 
                        with tenacious persistence, and it cannot be said to have ended until the signature 
                        of the agreement between England and the Congo State last May. But, prolonged and 
                        interesting as the struggle has been, it is not very generally known, and the 
                        detailed account of it will accordingly be welcome. We need not go through here 
                        all the intricate phases of the story. It is enough to say that the ambitions
                        which King Leopold conceived twenty years ago, when the Congo State had just been 
                        founded and Mandism was sweeping over the Sudan, have now been finally defeated. 
                        The Congo State remains, it is true, in occupation of the Lado enclave, but, by 
                        the terms under which thia territory was leased in 1894, the tenancy will last 
                        only daring the lifetime of King Leopold. A permanent Congolese occupation of any 
                        part of the Nile Basin, remarks the "Times," is now placed out of the question 
                        once and for alL. The history of how, in 1894, we actually came to lease to King Leopold Nile Basin,
                        and how the squence of events and the play of international forces rendered that agreement of no
                        effect, ia a very curious one, which deserves to be read in full. By the new agreement
                        of 1894 is formally annulled - an exception being made only for the temporary occupation
                        of the Lado enclave, to which we have referred - and the Congo State is definitely shut 
                        out from the Bhr el Ghazal. Thos who have followed King Leopold's policy in the Congo 
                        will not be surprised to hear that the Bahr el Gharal depends largely for its development
                        rubber. This is the reason, no doubt, why the Royal monpolist of the Congo rubber has been
                        so extremely anxious to ge into his hands. Time was when a liberal Government was prepared
                        to meet King Leopold half-way, and in 1894 a philanthropic Foreign Secretary like Lord Kimberley 
                        could still announce that his Majesty's "efforts to promote the civiliaation of Africa hare 
                        commanded their warm sympathy." But a gohappened in the lapse of time, and the present 
                        Government is better informed. It is, perhaps, undue assumption if we trace tha Government's
                        refusal to hand their fuller knowledge of the crying abuses in the Congo. No other Powers are
                        likely to object to their decision, since the incorporation of the Bahr el Ghaial the Congo 
                        State would only have meant the exclusion of all foreign trade and fair competition over a fresh 
                        trade of African territory. The Bahr el Ghazal is to be congratulated on having escaped a most 
                        unpleasant destiny. It is not very hard to guess what its fate would have been, if it had been added
                        to the rubber producing districts of the Congo. Probably there would have been another
                        great rubber treat, on the Congo pattern, with the State, or the King, holding half the 
                        shares. There would been the same enormous profits devoted, possible to further purchases of the
                        real estate in Belgium for the Crown domain. Behhind all this, the same odious system would have 
                        been at work. Rubber would have been wrung out of the wretched inhabitants by force, and, then 
                        when more rubber was not forthcoming the lash and the rifle and the cannibal native mercnaries 
                        would have been employed.</p>

                        our Church Building Fund. On January 22 of this year we had the sum of
                        £3,257 in the bask, contributed during the past five years by residents and
                        visitors in Khartoum, as well as by friends in England. With the additional
                        donations which have come in during the present years this sum has increased
                        to nearly £4,000. The estimated cost of the church is between £8,000 and
                        £10,000. The plans have already been approved by the Church Committee, and
                        have been prepared by Mr, Schultz, the well-known accelesiatical arichitect.
                        With the sum now available the building (or whioh the foundation-stone was
                        laid by Princess Henry of Battenberg in 1904) is to be begun before the end
                        of this year, and it is hoped that all those interested the erection of a

                 <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORESSPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Sunday.</p>
                    <p>The accident which happened to the P. &amp; O. S.S. Isis, and delayed the

                        miles from Brindisi last Monday. The fact a appear to be these: In very
                        moderate weather the starboard tail shaft snapped and the propeller was
                        lost. This naturally caused the starboard engine to race for some few
                        seconds. The result was that one of the cylinder covers blew up and two of
                        the tables in the smoking room were to a certain extent shattered by the
                        concussion. There was no danger to the lives of any who were on board even
                        to those in the engine room. Steam was shut off once and in about 15 seconds
                        the racing ceased, butt not before a good deal of damage was done to the
                        engine in question. There was some leakage from the stern tube, but not
                        enough to cause anxiety to those on board. It was fortunate that the
                        accident happened when and where it did—a quarter before, noon, and only
                        some 70 miles from Zante.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Suffolk appeared on the scene in response to telegrams, and her divers
                        were employed for several hours, but did not discover any serious damage to
                        the hull of the ship. It was decided that she could with safety proceed on
                        her voyage and she left trusting to the port enginge. An average of about 14
                        knots was maintained from Zante to Port Said and vessel arrived at her
                        destination soon after 2 p.m. on Saturday, and transferred her mail to the
                        Persia, which had been waiting since Tuesday last.</p>
                    <p>The fiction as to the vessel having gone on shore or touched the ground
                        anywhere is absurd.</p>
                    <p>For the present the Isis is quite bors de combat and repairs to the engine
                        will take some weeks.</p>
                    <p>A Passenger's Account.</p>
                    <p>The following account is furnished by a passenger:-</p>
                    <p>The BRindisi mail steamer left Brindiai with the Indian and Egyptian mails on
                        Sunday shortly after midnight, carrying about 60 passengers. Towards Monday
                        morning became rather rough, which caused the vessel to pitch considerably.
                        About 11 a.m. when near Cephalonia a tremendous explosion took place which
                        shook the vessel from stem stern with great violence, and it felt as though
                        she were going to pieces. The force of the concussion threw the smoking room
                        card tables into the air, smashing them to atms; the smoking room being
                        situated immediately above the engine room.</p>
                    <p>The Captain, third engineer, and the engine room staff had miraculous escape.
                        The Captain was standing close by at the time of the explosion. He at once
                        gave orders for the hosts be cleared, thinking from the report that serious
                        damage bad ben done to the hull which was only natural seeing that shaft and
                        propeller broken and fallen into the sea, and the cylinder had burst. Ther
                        was no panic whatsoever either amongst the passengers or crew; in fact the
                        Italian crew behaved splendidly. Mr. Turnball, the supernumerary third
                        engineer, who was in charge at the time, very bravely remained in his post,
                        and with great presence of mind rushed and closed the throttle valve and so
                        prevented the rush and escape of the steam, which otherwise would have
                        scaleded everyone in the engine room, which after the explosion was a wreck. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Kendall, the chief engineer, was quite equal to the occasion and managed
                        to keep the steamer moving slowly ahead with the remaining egine and
                        propeller, but the vessel was making water fast, and the after part of the
                        ship commenced slowly settling dow in the water. Captain Watkins, who was
                        quite alive to the situation, decided to steer direcr for the Island of
                        Zante, where the steamer arrived about dark. In the meantime pumping was
                        going on incesstantly, but the in rush of the water was gaining on the pump.
                        Once inside the harbour of Zante the pumps were in a better position to work
                        and therfore more efficaceous, and in this way they were able to keep down
                        the leakage.</p>
                    <p>Captain Watking at once wired for the assistance on board and on Wednesday
                        afternoon at 5 p.m. H.M.S Suffolk arrived from Malta.</p>
                    <p>The commander at once boarded the Isis accopanied by his chief-engieer and
                        chief carpenter, and shortly afterwards a large pentoon containing divers;
                        apparatus, a staff of blue jackets and four expert divers came alongside and
                        at once commenced operations assisted by the officers and engineers of the
                        Isis. They worked the whole of Wednesday night by the aid of electric light,
                        enabling the divers to see under the water. Operations were sucessfully
                        terminated on Thursday at 9 a.m.</p>
                    <p>Before the arrival of H.M.S Suffolk, the first officer, Mr. Cyril Brook, the
                        second officer, Mr. D.J Cornwall Jones, and the fourth officer, Mr. A.N
                        Gannery, successfully carried out the commander's plane for ascertaining the
                        damage, the two latter diving down under the ship's stern, where they
                        eventually succeeded in inserting a wooden plug of very large dimensions
                        into the hole caused by the breaking off of the propeller. Great praise is
                        due to these young officers, who voluntarily undertook this arduous
                        enterprise which was in reality the work of a trained and expert diver, and
                        the divers themselves expressed their admiration and suprise that such a
                        piece of work could have been done without the aid of a diving
                        apparatus.</p>
             <cb n="5"/>        
                    <p>Everything was finished by Thursday morning and the Isis left Zante at 9.30
                        a.m. that day direct for Port Said, which was reached on Saturday, the 6th
                        inst., at 2 p.m., having steamed with one egine and propeller at a rate of
                        about 14 knots per hour. Fortunately fair weatehr was encountered all the
                        way from Zante.</p>
                    <p>It was only by the persistent efforts of captain, officers, and crew that an
                        appalling disaster was avoided, and it was the unaminous feeling of the
                        passengers that the P. &amp; O. Company should be proud of having such men
                        in their service. Great praise and admiration is due to Captain Watkins for
                        the energetic and prompt manner in which he carried out every thing
                        incidental to the accident, - and also to the officeres, engineers' staff,
                        and crew fo rtheir splendid co-operation throughout the whole incident.</p>
                    <p>Before reaching Port Said a testimonial was presented to Captain Watkins and
                        officers of the Isis signed by all the passengers expressing their
                        admiration praise and gratitude for the effective manner in which everything
                        had been carried out with a view on their saftey. The following is a copu of
                        the testimonial:</p>
                    <p>To Captain Wattins &amp; the Officers.</p>
                    <p>P. &amp;. O.  S.S. Isis</p>
                    <p>at Sea </p>
                    <p>5 Ootober, 1906. </p>
                    <p>The following passengers on board the P. &amp; O. steamer Isis at the time of
                        the very serious accident to her machinery on the 1st October 1906 desire to
                        place on record their appreciation of the manner in which the Commander,
                        offciers, engineers, and crew of the shp have faced the difficulties of so
                        critical a situation.</p>
                    <p>We wish in the first place to express our sincere sympathy with Captain
                        Watkin and the chief engineer, Mr. Kendal, in the grave anxiety caused to
                        them by the disater, and trust that these officers wil reocgnize that it is
                        fully understood by all on board, both that everything possible was done to
                        secure the immediate saftey of the vessel, and also that when it was decided
                        to discontinue the voyage at Zante the great responsibility of determining
                        what action to take was in our opinion exercised I the wisest possible
                        manner. Further our best thanks are due to the Commander for the ready
                        manner in which the form time to time communicated to us all information
                        which teneded to relive our anxiety, and for the courtesy with which he has
                        meet acquires as to the prospects of continuing the voyage as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>We wish to avoide reference to technical matters, but we are wll aware that
                        prompt action taken by Mr. Turnball, engineer in charge, and the engineer in
                        charge, and the engine room staff at the time of the accident reduced to a
                        minimum the dangerous consequences of the disastrous explosion. We are
                        informed that it was through Mr. Turnball's bravey in remaining as he did at
                        his post at a moment of extreme danger, and to his presence of mind in doing
                        exactly the right thing at the right moment, that an appalling catastrophe
                        was avoided. </p>
                    <p>We also express our warm appreciation of the efficient manner in which
                        subsequent to our arrival at Zante, Mr. Brook, and those under him in
                        particular Mr. Cornwall Jones and Mr. Gunnery carried out the Commanders
                        plan for ascertaining the damage done and for temporarily remedying the more
                        serious injury to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The pluck and readiness of resource with which the work was done without the
                        assistance of trained divers cannot be too higly praised.</p>
                    <p>We offer our heartiest congratulations to Captain Watkins and all concerned
                        on the success with which their efforts were crowned, and trust that they
                        will look back with pride upon the incidents of a voyage which but for the
                        high standard of efficiency maintained on board the Isis might so easily
                        have been attended with far graver consequences.</p>

                        the Germania on Saturday afternoon. This second ship is still larger than
                        the Nubia, and will have accomodation for a hundred passengers. She has been
                        built to run in the new regular passenger service from Cairo to Assouan,
                        where she will connect with Nubia in conjunction with the well known

                        admirable care. Spacious state rooms will be unusually well got up;and
                        dinning and ladies' saloons and smoking room are well ventilated, and fitted
                        up in the excellent tase. As in the case of the Nubia, the forward portion
                        of the upper deck is arranged as a promande, and provided with a handsome
                        wind screen in which piste glass windows have been fixed so as to gurantee
                        the maximum protection combined with the fullest enjoyment of the view. In

                        department of the Company have well sustained the reputation that they have
                        so deservedly earned, as the Nubia was launched only 3 weeks after the
                        arrival of the Material and the Germania two week later. </p>
                    <p>The Christening cermony was performed by Mrs. Diacono, wife of the manager of
                        the company, who broke a bottle of champagne over the bow of the boat, and
                        in a few well-chosen words wished the company and the vessel every success.
                        Many guests were present and after the cermony were entertained on board the
                        Nubia in the saloon of which tea and other refreshments were served.</p>
